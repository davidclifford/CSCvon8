Problems with VGS PCB v1.0 1/6/2021

1. Missing things

Should have thicker tracks for VCC
Big capacitor by power input for DC smoothing
Switch to turn on/off
LEDs to show power on, and maybe read/write?

2. Mistakes

Pixel ROM - VCC -> VSS, GND -> VDD i.e. the wrong way around
Counters - RCO -> CEP, should have been CET
Control signal buffer (74x173) - Reset set to VCC should have been GND
Control ROM - VSync and HSync wrong way around, updated ROM rather than fix hardware
