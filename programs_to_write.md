List of possible applications, games and programs to write for the CSCvon8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Soon:
1. Sudoku solver (done)
2. Maze generator (done)
3. Maze solver
4. Rogue like game
5. 3D monster maze
6. Proportional spaced font

Later:
1. C or other language Compiler (on PC in Java or Python)
2. Update monitor with more utility functions, e.g. line drawing
3. Improve monitor e.g. improve RNG, small text (pack into bytes)
4. More commands on monitor e.g. V000 to dump video memory on screen (done)
5. Java based Terminal emulator with file system (on PC)
6. Use same data for both small and large fonts (will be slower?)

Hardware:
1. Re-design VGA card (again!) using 74HC590 counters and maybe direct memory access
2. Design VGA card PCB and build without breadboards (done)
3. Increase resolution to 200x150 with 18mhz crystal (30,000 byte storage)
4. Make asynchronous?
5. Add sound and keyboard interface
	a. Sound: Like Spectrum beep or more sophisticated?
	b. Keyboard. Run monitor from keyboard and use VGA small text for output?

Long-term:
Make improved CPU with all I've learned so far
1. Pipelined CPU
2. RISC CPU
3. 16-bit CPU
4. Write simulators for above
5. 24-bit Address or banked/paged memory
6. Use 6502 or Z80 or microcontroller?
